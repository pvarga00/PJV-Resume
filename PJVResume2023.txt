Senior Quality Assurance Engineer (2013 - 2014)
- Helped to design, build, test, deploy, monitor, and maintain & support the company’s first hyper-media API
- Automated User-Interface Testing (self-created C# coded solution, leveraging VSStudio)
- Unit Testing (C#)
- Created and maintained CI/CD deployment pipelines (ADS/Jenkins)
- Implemented SonarQube for the Enterprise & FOCs

Some key professional highlights:
- I personally ideated, and then implemented a multi-year, cross-company wide SonarQube initaitive, for measuring code metrics for all instrumented code bases, across all of our development languages (C#/.Net, PHP, F#, Progress, Angular, JS, TS, Java, etc.). This included setting up all documentation, training, and implementing API based back=end solutions to coordinate CI/CD deployment pipelines (ADS/CircleCI, etc.) to include code scanning/linting for: code smells/defects, security validation (OWASP10+), tech debt identification, unit testing and code coverage, duplicated code, etc.
	- This lead to safer/better code, less defects escaping into Production, more capable developers who were better trained in their craft.
- Security: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scanning initiatives (multi-year, cross-company initiatives, scanning all deployed applications) - leveraging/partnering with Acunetix, and later AppSpider Enterprise (Rapid7) solutions.
	- Built and implemented multiple solutions for DAST scanning of applications and APIs for all 
- Large Scale Projects Coordination & Project Management:
